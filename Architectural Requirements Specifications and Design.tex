	\section{Requirements and Constraints}\label{sec:requirements}

	The following section provides all the requirements of NavUP, and possible constraints regarding the mobile application.
			\subsection{External Interface Requirements}\label{subsec:external}
			This section provides a detailed description of all the inputs and outputs of the system. Descriptions of the user, hardware, software and communication interfaces are also provided.
			\subsubsection{User interfaces}
			Upon opening the application, a first time user (or a user that had logged out) should see the splash page - Figure 1. The splash page will allow a user to continue as a guest (without logging in) or login in as a user. The user can either swipe left to login or right to use the application as a guest. \\
			
			The log in page (Figure 2) should prompt the user to enter their login details (user name \& password). If the user has not yet created an account, they will be prompted to register a new account before they can use or continue with the application. The user register page bears resemblance to the login page prototype, but includes input fields for the user's email address and two password fields (one for the actual password, and another to verify the previously entered password). \\
			
			In addition to being able to register as a new user, a user should be able to view, update and/or delete their profile. The prototype of this page is shown on Figure 3; on this page, a user can perform CRUD operations (excluding CREATE) on their profiles. Admin profiles will have additional options (e.g. making a normal user an administrator user). These options will appear in the "User Details" page.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\centering{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./images/User_Details.JPG}}
	\caption{User Details Screen}
	\endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}

A user should be able to find the directions between two (or more) points. The user should also be provided with additional features to improve the navigation between these points, these include but are not limited to the shortest route. Figure 4 shows the search page to find directions between two points, and Figure 5 shows the results and further filtering options to improve the nature of the directions.\\

\begin{figure}[H]

	\centering{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./images/Get_Directions_Search.JPG}}
	\caption{Get Directions Search Screen}
	\endminipage\hfill

	\caption{Get Directions Result Screen}
	\endminipage\hfill
	\minipage{0.3\textwidth}
	\centering{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./images/POI_Results.JPG}}
	\caption{Search Locations Result(s) Screen}
	\endminipage\hfill
\end{figure}

Users should also be able to get their current location, save various points of interest and search for a location. Figure 6 shows the prototype page for the results produced after a user has searched for a location. \\

A user should also be able to send a notification. The notification page should have a similar layout as the other pages shown across Figure 1 - 6.
			\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
			Since NavUP uses existing hardware (i.e. smart devices), it does not require direct hardware interfaces other than the interfaces that are provided by the user's device. The GPS features are explicitly managed by the user's device, particularly the operating system on which the device runs.
			\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
			NavUP communicates with the device's GPS to get data about the user's location and the other geographical information regarding the user's location. Furthermore, the application communicates with the on-campus wireless hotspots to tag the relative location of a user within a building. NavUP will mostly just perform read operations, which are communicated to the application via the device's operating system.
			\subsubsection{Communication interfaces}
			The application will be heavily dependent on the device's GPS; without this communication NavUP will be unable to perform any location specific operations (including getting the user's current location). The application also needs a working wireless network connection in order to facilitate communication with the GPS's remote database. The wireless hotspots within the university will also be required to get the user's relative building location; without this, it may be difficult to provide accurate results.

			\subsection{Performance Requirements}\label{subsec:performance}
				This section provides a detailed specification of the user's interaction with NavUP, as well as the measures put in place to ensure good system performance.
			
			\subsubsection{Intuitive user interface}

			    \end{figure}
			    {The activity diagram for the User Management Model is displayed in the figure above. It illustrates the registration and login steps of the system, when a user connects as a guest.egistration and login steps of the system, when a user connects as a guest. \\\\
				Initially the guest user will connect to the service/system, it will then be able to login or register. If the User chooses neither of these option it will be displayed the Public services of the system, and it will not be able to access the attributes of being a registered user.\\\\
				If the user wishes to register/login then it will be displayed the register/login page. A registered user will need to enter its credentials to login and if the correct information is entered then it will display the logged-in page, where it can view its information. If the incorrect information is entered, an error message will be displayed and the user will be able to re-enter its credentials.\\\\
				If a user wishes to register, the system will display the registration page and the user will need to enter in the registration information.  The system will check if the email is registred and if it is then it will display an error message. If the email is not registered it will create the account and notify the user that its account has been created.\\\\
				If the user is an admin, it will be able to access the admin rights from the logged-in page.}

					 \label{fig:user_sequence}
			    \end{figure}
			    {This Diagram shows the sequence of events the system will use to register a user. The Controller class will first authenticate the email address, and check that it is not currently in the system already and that it is a valid email address. Once this is done the Controller class will use the Participant class to register the user with a name, surname, email address and password. The Participant class will then create the user and set the appropriate fields in the User class. After this is done a boolean variable will be sent back to the controller class indicating if the registration was successful.\\\\
			    The System will then encrypt and store the password on its database, this is to ensure that the user password cannot be compromised.}
